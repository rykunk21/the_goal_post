# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an NFL game prediction dashboard that leverages statistical insights and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to analyze betting lines against data-driven predictions. The system will retrieve NFL game data, perform statistical analysis, and present a dashboard showing upcoming games with current betting lines alongside statistical recommendations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 - Functional: Data Retrieval and Storage

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically retrieve and store NFL game data locally, so that I can perform statistical analysis without relying on external APIs during analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL retrieve current NFL schedule data and store it locally
2. WHEN new game data becomes available THEN the system SHALL update the local database automatically
3. WHEN historical game data is needed THEN the system SHALL provide access to at least 3 seasons of historical data
4. IF data retrieval fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with cached data
5. WHEN storing game data THEN the system SHALL include team statistics, player performance metrics, and betting line history

### Requirement 2 - Functional: MCMC Statistical Analysis

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to generate game predictions, so that I can understand the statistical probability distributions of game outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a game THEN the system SHALL apply MCMC sampling to generate probability distributions for game outcomes
2. WHEN MCMC analysis completes THEN the system SHALL provide confidence intervals for predicted scores
3. WHEN multiple games are analyzed THEN the system SHALL process them efficiently using parallel computation
4. IF MCMC convergence fails THEN the system SHALL retry with adjusted parameters and log the issue
5. WHEN generating predictions THEN the system SHALL incorporate team performance trends, player injuries, and historical matchup data

### Requirement 3 - Functional: Betting Line Comparison

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see current betting lines compared against statistical predictions, so that I can identify potential value opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying a game THEN the system SHALL show current betting lines from multiple sources
2. WHEN statistical analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL highlight discrepancies between lines and predictions
3. WHEN a line significantly differs from predictions THEN the system SHALL flag it with a confidence score
4. IF betting line data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL indicate missing data clearly
5. WHEN comparing lines THEN the system SHALL show both point spread and over/under predictions

### Requirement 4 - Aesthetic: Dashboard Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive dashboard interface, so that I can quickly understand game predictions and betting line comparisons.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display upcoming games in chronological order
2. WHEN viewing game information THEN the system SHALL use clear visual indicators for prediction confidence
3. WHEN lines differ significantly from predictions THEN the system SHALL use color coding to highlight opportunities
4. WHEN displaying statistical data THEN the system SHALL use charts and graphs for easy interpretation
5. WHEN the interface loads THEN it SHALL be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices

### Requirement 5 - Aesthetic: Data Visualization

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visualizations of statistical analysis results, so that I can understand the reasoning behind predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCMC analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display probability distribution charts
2. WHEN showing team comparisons THEN the system SHALL use comparative visualizations
3. WHEN displaying historical trends THEN the system SHALL show time-series charts
4. WHEN presenting confidence intervals THEN the system SHALL use error bars or shaded regions
5. WHEN multiple metrics are shown THEN the system SHALL organize them in a clear, hierarchical layout

### Requirement 6 - Performance: Real-time Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to update in real-time, so that I always see the most current information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new betting lines are available THEN the system SHALL update the display within 5 minutes
2. WHEN game status changes THEN the system SHALL reflect updates immediately
3. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN it SHALL maintain performance with up to 100 concurrent users
4. IF system load increases THEN response times SHALL remain under 2 seconds for dashboard loading
5. WHEN background analysis runs THEN it SHALL not impact frontend responsiveness

### Requirement 7 - Performance: Analysis Efficiency

**User Story:** As a user, I want statistical analysis to complete quickly, so that predictions are available when I need them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running MCMC analysis THEN it SHALL complete within 30 seconds per game
2. WHEN analyzing a full week of games THEN the system SHALL complete all predictions within 5 minutes
3. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL prioritize upcoming games
4. IF analysis takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators
5. WHEN caching results THEN the system SHALL reuse computations to improve subsequent analysis speed

### Requirement 8 - Functional: Python Integration for EDA

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Python-based exploratory data analysis results, so that I can leverage advanced statistical libraries for deeper insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Python analysis completes THEN the system SHALL import results into the Rust backend
2. WHEN EDA identifies new patterns THEN the system SHALL incorporate findings into prediction models
3. WHEN Python scripts run THEN they SHALL output results in a format consumable by the Rust system
4. IF Python integration fails THEN the system SHALL continue with Rust-only analysis
5. WHEN aggregating Python results THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity before use
