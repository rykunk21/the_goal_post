# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an NFL game prediction dashboard that leverages statistical insights and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to analyze betting lines against data-driven predictions. The system will retrieve NFL game data, perform statistical analysis, and present a dashboard showing upcoming games with current betting lines alongside statistical recommendations.

## Current Implementation Status

The system currently has a robust foundation with:
- Complete database schema management using surrealdb_migrations crate
- Comprehensive migration system with schema definitions, indexes, and NFL team seed data
- Established data models for games, teams, betting lines, and predictions
- Working REST API endpoints for basic CRUD operations
- Database connection management with retry logic and health checks
- Migration tracking and rollback capabilities

5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL be self-contained without requiring external file dependencies
6. WHEN refactoring existing temp/ dependencies THEN the system SHALL migrate functionality to proper service modules with clear interfaces

#### Current Violations (To Be Addressed)

**VIOLATION 1: Tasks 2.1 and 2.2** - Currently depend on temp/nfl_predictions.csv, temp/predictions_table.html, and temp/betting_table.html for data loading and parsing

**VIOLATION 2: Frontend Mock Data Form** - References temp/nfl_predictions.csv file for bulk data import

**VIOLATION 3: Python Scripts** - Multiple Python scripts in temp/ directory (probability_analysis.py, analyze_value.py, parse_html_to_csv.py) that should be refactored into proper data collection services

**VIOLATION 4: Dashboard Hard-coded Data** - Dashboard component contains hard-coded data that appears to come from temp/ directory analysis scripts rather than proper service interfaces

**Refactoring Required:**
- Move Python analysis logic into backend data collection service
- Replace file-based data exchange with proper API endpoints
- Implement proper data ingestion pipeline without temp file dependencies
- Create service interfaces for prediction analysis and betting line collection
